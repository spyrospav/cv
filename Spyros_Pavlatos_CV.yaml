      - name: 'λ-trim Debloater'
        start_date: 2024
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - Designed a debloating algorithm that leverages established dynamic
            analysis techniques and a cost model to optimize serverless applications.
          - Implemented the algorithm in a tool that can be used to debloat Python
            and serverless applications and achieved up to 20% reduction in cold start
            time and cost when deployed on AWS Lambda.
          - Actively maintanining the open-source version of the tool.
        summary: Debloater for Python and serverless applications
      - name: '[MuCache](https://github.com/eniac/mucache)'
        start_date: 2022
        end_date: 2023
        highlights:
          - Implemented various applications to test and evaluate the proposed framework.
          - Verfiied the correctness of the caching framework with a pen-and-paper proof.
        summary: Caching framework for microservices
      - name: '[PM-Benchmarks](https://github.com/spyrospav/pm-benchmarks)'
        start_date: 2021
        end_date: 2022
        highlights:
          - Developed a test suite consisting of litmus tests and complex data structures
            for model checking persistent memory programs under the Px86 memory persistency 
            model.
          - Tested the state-of-the-art model checker [GenMC](https://github.com/MPI-SWS/genmc)
            against the test suite and reported some critical internal bugs in the tool.
        summary: Test suite for model checking persistent memory programs
