# Projects

## λ-trim Debloater

- 2024 – present
- Designed a debloating algorithm that leverages established dynamic analysis techniques and a cost model to optimize serverless applications.
- Implemented the algorithm in a tool that can be used to debloat Python and serverless applications and achieved up to 20% reduction in cold start time and cost when deployed on AWS Lambda.
- Actively maintanining the open-source version of the tool.

## [MuCache](https://github.com/eniac/mucache)

- 2022 – 2023
- Implemented various applications to test and evaluate the proposed framework.
- Verfiied the correctness of the caching framework with a pen-and-paper proof.

## [PM-Benchmarks](https://github.com/spyrospav/pm-benchmarks)

- 2021 – 2022
- Developed a test suite consisting of litmus tests and complex data structures for model checking persistent memory programs under the Px86 memory persistency model.
- Tested the state-of-the-art model checker [GenMC](https://github.com/MPI-SWS/genmc) against the test suite and reported some critical internal bugs in the tool.
